of and relating to the Cyclus fuel cycle

are:

* Community Manager: `Amanda M. Bachmann <https://github.com/abachma2>`_ *insert Community Manager roles*

Each repository will have their own README, 
CONTRIBUTING, and LICENSE, but some information that is 
relevant to all repositories:
* Follow up each of the procedures outlined in the `Cyclus 
  Enhancement Proposals (CEPs) <https://fuelcycle.org/cep/cep0.html>`_
* All PRs should address an open issue. If an issue for your
  PR does not exist, please make an issue first
* The three repositories listed above have a discussions tab, 
  which is the ideal place to ask questions about installation, 
  use, suggest ideas, etc.
