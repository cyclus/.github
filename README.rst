# Cyclus Organization

This organization encompasses the repositories 
of and relating to the Cyclus fuel cycle 
simulator code. The three most-used repositories
are:
* Cyclus
* Cycamore
* Cymetric 

The structure of the organization is:
* The Council of PIs (draft `CEP7 <https://github.com/cyclus/cyclus.github.com/pull/296>`_)
* Community Manager: `Amanda M. Bachmann <https://github.com/abachma2>`_ *insert Community Manager roles*

Each repository will have their own README, 
CONTRIBUTING, and LICENSE, but some information that is 
relevant to all repositories:
* Follow up each of the procedures outlined in the `Cyclus 
  Enhancement Proposals (CEPs) <https://fuelcycle.org/cep/cep0.html>`_
* All PRs should address an open issue. If an issue for your
  PR does not exist, please make an issue first
* When creating an issue or PR, it can be a:
  * Bug: Something is broken in the code and it is not working 
    as one would expect
  * Feature: You are requesting or adding in a new capability 
    that does not exist in the code currently
  * Task: Something that is not a bug or a feature; may be 
    more administrative in nature, such as updating 
    documentation.
* The three repositories listed above have a discussions tab, 
  which is the ideal place to ask questions about installation, 
  use, suggest ideas, etc. 

More information about Cyclus and the organization can be
